    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is <strong>Zain Ali</strong>.
      I am a passionate <strong>Web Developer</strong> and <strong>Designer</strong> with experience in building modern,
      responsive, and SEO-friendly websites.
    </p>

    <p>
      My journey in technology started with curiosity ðŸ’¡ and quickly turned into a career.
      Over the years, I have worked with different clients and businesses to create professional websites that not only
      look beautiful but also perform well.
    </p>

    <p>
      I focus on <span class="highlight">clean design</span>, <span class="highlight">fast loading speed</span>, and
      <span class="highlight">secure coding practices</span>.
      My goal is to turn ideas into real digital products that help businesses grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Apart from coding, I also enjoy learning new technologies, designing user-friendly layouts, and helping brands
      improve their online presence through SEO and digital marketing.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are looking for a reliable and creative developer, Iâ€™d love to work with you ðŸš€
